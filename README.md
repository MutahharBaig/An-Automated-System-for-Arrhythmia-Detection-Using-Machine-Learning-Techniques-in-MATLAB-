# An-Automated-System-for-Arrhythmia-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques-in-MATLAB-
The main goal of this research is to  develop a reliable system that can recognize different kinds of arrhythmias using  electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. By employing MATLAB's vast toolkit and machine learning  methods, a successful approach was developed and put into practice.
